When I was at university, I made *a lot* of hot chocolate.
It was a way to meet new people ("Hey, we're making hot chocolate for 4, but we're three, wanna join?"), and to share some love, comfort, and happiness.

With my friend [Michael](https://michaelpaper.xyz), we even did this on a large scale by creating a [hot chocolate association](https://chocopoly.ch), and served 1100L+ of vegan hot chocolate! üéâ

I was surprised to see how bad people were at making hot chocolate, especially in Switzerland, where hot chocolate is usually "mix a powder with milk and microwave"... and doesn't even have chocolate!

There's so much more. I'll try to share here how I make and think about making hot chocolate most of the time.


## Recipe template

The base template I use is quite simple. You'll want some milks, some dark chocolate, cocoa, something sweet, spices, and if possible a source of fat among them.

### Ingredients for 4 mugs

- **1L of oat milk** (not sweetened, not flavored)
If you want a richer drink, you can replace 25cl of oat milk by plant-based cream. Soy, millet, or almond are great options.
- **100g of 60%+ dark chocolate** (note: the result will be different if it‚Äôs 50% or 90%, you may want to adapt the sugar)
- **1 big tablespoon of cocoa powder** (not a mix, pure cocoa)
- **3 tablespoons of something sweet** (scale to taste). Choose one from the following options:
  - brown sugar
  - syrup (chestnut, maple, mint, ‚Ä¶)
  - caramel
  - chestnut or speculoos spread (that's an easy win)
  - Sweet condensed oat milk (in this case, use 25cl and remove 25cl of milk)
- **Optional but great:**
  - Cinnamon
  - ‚Öì of a tonka bean

> ### The original Albert
> Originally, the Albert uses oat milk (50cl), soy cream (25cl), sweet condensed milk (25cl, made from 50cl of oat milk and ~150g sugar), 70% dark chocolate, and cocoa, cinnamon, and tonka beans, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of instant coffee. The toppings were unsweetened vegan whipped cream with grated dark chocolate.


## Instructions
1. In a saucepan, heat the milks with the sweetener of your choice over medium heat until it starts to steam. Do not let it boil.
2. Add the cocoa powder. If desired, add cinnamon and grate the tonka beans.
3. Break the dark chocolate into small pieces and add them to the saucepan. It often helps to not put it all at once.
4. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and well combined with the milk.
5. You can let it simmer for a bit, stirring regularly. It will make the hot chocolate more dense, but be careful that it does not boil.
6. Pour into mugs or cups and enjoy!

## Bonus for a great experience

That's the core, but if you want to make someone extra happy, here's a few directions for one more level up of your hot chocolate.

### Chocolate cups
Just before serving, you can melt a few squares of chocolate on a plate in a microwave, and dip the top of your mugs in it. It's fantastic: you have pure dark chocolate melting on your lips that contrasts with the sweeter hot chocolate. And it looks wonderful, no inner child can resist this.

Be careful when melting the chocolate, as chocolate overcooks very fast, so the best is to put it for a very short time in the microwave (15-30s) stir a bit, and repeat if needed.

### Whipped cream

If you want a richer drink, whipped cream is always a nice addition. You'll have a hard time finding a vegan one (there's [this one](https://www.migros.ch/en/product/204143000000)), so you will likely need to make it. Most plant-based creams cannot be whipped, because they don't have enough fat. In general, any cream with less than 18% fat will not whisk well. Try to find some that are especially marketed as ‚Äúwhippable‚Äù, like [this one](https://www.oatly.com/products/cream/whippable-creamy-oat-250ml).

Also remember the two ingredients of whipped cream are fat and cold. Make sure the cream is cold, the bowl too can be put in the fridge before being used. If it doesn‚Äôt seem to work, you can stop, put everything back into the fridge (or freezer) and continue afterwards.

If you add whipped cream to your hot chocolate, take the small extra effort to grate a bit of dark chocolate on top of it, it adds a great feeling.

Last tip, most commercial whipped cream is sweetened, but you don‚Äôt have to! If your drink is already very sweet, for instance because you used condensed milk, don‚Äôt add sugar to the whipped cream, it'll balance nicely. On the other hand, if your drink is not sweet, maybe because you did not add any sweetener, then you can balance it with 1-2 tablespoons of sugar in the whipped cream. Of course, you can also go all in or all out with sugar‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs your preference. What about making cinnamon whipped cream?

### Making the flavour richer
If you want to make the flavour explode even more in your palate, you can add any combination of:
- A pinch of salt (not much, you don‚Äôt want your drink to be salty)
- A pinch of instant coffee (not much either)
- A bit of alcohol, for instance amaretto (a bit‚Ä¶ or a lot!)

Those three are flavour enhancers which will make the taste richer. Another one is fat, but adding oil to your chocolate is unlikely to make you happy. Though it‚Äôs half of the reason why using cream makes the hot chocolate better (the other reason being the texture).

### I am speeeed üèé

If you're in a rush, you can make it in the microwave. No shame in this! It's especially convenient if you're 1-3 or if you want to make custom hot chocolate for each of your guests.

If you do so, my tip is to start by melting 1 bar of chocolate in the mug in which you want to serve it, with just enough milk to cover the chocolate. Be careful not to overcook the chocolate: put it for 20-30s in the microwave, stir, and start again if needed. Then fill the rest of the mug with the milk, and the other ingredients, warm them up in the microwave and serve.

### Experiment!
Hot chocolate can be a personal evolving art. Adapt to the situation, your desires or those of your guests.

You can add ginger, orange, use water and more chocolate instead of milk, you can not sweeten it or use different sugars. You can add spices, paprika, basil, mint, any syrup, berries, speculoos spread, matcha, thyme. You can make it and put it in your fridge for a cold chocolate and use cocoa butter for more fat. You can use pepper or mix it with alcohol or put much less milk and have it dense. You can make it more Italian with maizena or [Colombian and add cheese in it](https://foreignfork.com/colombian-hot-chocolate-with-cheese/).
You can put orange juice or let it simmer for a long time, use carob instead of cocoa. You can put garlic or just replace the milk.

### Using a different milk
You can replace the oat milk with another plant-based milk and you will get a different result. Here‚Äôs some of my opinion on the different milks:
- Oat milk is a great default. A lot of people don‚Äôt even realise it‚Äôs oat milk in the chocolate until you tell them. It‚Äôs nice.
- Almond and soy milk are more risky. Some people love them, some hate them in the chocolate. Especially almond.
- Hazelnut is really nice, but also more expensive.
- Millet has a wonderful taste, but you‚Äôll have a harder time finding it. You can make it yourself though.
- I used multiple times a mix of hazelnut-spelt-millet. A bit more expensive, but has a great taste.
- Don‚Äôt use milks that have vanilla or are sweetened. Is usually doesn‚Äôt taste great in hot chocolate. I expect some of them to be great though, but it might depend on the specific brand. Try at your own risk.
- Also, don‚Äôt use cow milk, obviously.


May you have a wonderful time! üç´
